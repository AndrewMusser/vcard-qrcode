# DESCRIPTION
This is a simple script that generates a stylized QR code based on vCard info. It's useful if you want to give others an easy way to store your contact info in their phone. 

# USAGE
First you'll need to install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt` .

Then you should customize the `contact.vcf` file with your own info. 

Next you'll want to replace `Logo-with-circle.png` with your own logo or custom image. 

You can then run the sample with `python main.py`. 

Note that additional customizations can easily be made in `main.py` (i.e. changing the colors, sizes, or module drawers).
